# Predicting users' default card payment based on their client profiles:
* In this project, I am aiming to utilize different regression models to predict whether users will experience default payment in the next month using their account information and other personal factors such as age, gender and marriage status. To define what __default payment__ is, James Chen, through an article on Investopedia, states that the failure of borrowers to make required repayments on a debt for businesses or lenders in general. This issue may pose significant impacts credit card users as it may damage users' credit scores as well as their ability to borrow in the future.

* The dataset used in this project was a collection of credit card users in Taiwan, collected by the Department of Information at Chung Hua University and the Department of Civil Engineering at Tangkam University in Taiwan.
